# What’s Missing & Current State (AstraMark)

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

This doc answers: what you see when you click Pitch Deck / Content Calendar / Email Sequence, what’s static vs dynamic, what’s missing now, and how that lines up with QUICK_START and PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.

---

## 1. What you see when you click Pitch Deck / Content Calendar / Email Sequence

### Before (fixed)

- **“View Generated”** did nothing useful: it either re-ran generation or only showed a tiny preview (e.g. first 2–3 slides, first 2 emails, or just “X posts over Y weeks”).
- The **terminal** only showed new lines when you actually called the backend (e.g. “Generate”, PDF download, analyze). Clicking the small preview did not trigger any new API call.

### After (current behavior)

- **“View Generated”** now opens a **full-content modal** for that asset:
  - **Pitch Deck:** All slides with title, bullet list, and speaker notes.
  - **Content Calendar:** All weeks → days → posts (channel, time, topic, caption, hashtags).
  - **Email Sequence:** All emails with subject, preview text, body, and CTA/link.
- So: **the only “output” when you click Pitch Deck / Content Calendar / Email Sequence is no longer just the tiny preview** — it’s the full content in a modal (and no extra API call in the terminal when you only click “View Generated”).

### Terminal output

- **PDF:** `GET /api/export/pdf/{id}` → 200 (download).
- **Pitch Deck / Content Calendar / Email:** You see `POST /api/generate/pitch-deck`, `.../content-calendar`, `.../email-sequence` **only when you click “Generate”**, not when you click “View Generated” (that only opens the modal with already-fetched data).
- **Analysis:** `POST /api/analyze` → 200; if SERP isn’t configured you’ll see “SERP API not configured, returning mock data”.
- **Market scan:** “Starting market scan…”, “Market scan completed. Generated N signals” when the background scanner runs.

So: **no**, the terminal lines you shared are not the only output for those features — the main output is now the **full-content modals** when you click “View Generated”.

## 2. What’s static vs dynamic

| Area | Static vs dynamic | Notes |
|------|--------------------|--------|
| **Ad (Live Preview Generator)** | **Partly static** | Layout and brand (“AstraMark Brand”, “Learn More”) are fixed. **Dynamic:** headline and body come from the first strategy’s `content_ideas` (e.g. `strategy.content_ideas[0]`, `strategy.content_ideas[1]`). If the analysis has no strategies or no `content_ideas`, it falls back to default copy — so it can look “static” when data is missing. |
| **Market Trend Analysis** | **Static / placeholder** | Blurred/locked for non‑Pro. Values (e.g. “CPM Trend -12%”) are placeholder. Keeping blurred for now; enable later. |
| **Competitor Intel** | **Static / placeholder** | Blurred/locked for non‑Pro. “Competitor A/B” and metrics are placeholders. Keeping blurred for now. |
| **Overview, SWOT, Personas, Strategies** | **Dynamic (AI)** | Generated from your business input and (when configured) real/mock SERP. |
| **Pitch Deck / Calendar / Email** | **Dynamic (AI)** | Generated by backend (Gemini). Full content is shown in the new modals when you click “View Generated”. |
| **Blockchain proof** | **Dynamic (DB or chain)** | Stored per analysis; if blockchain isn’t configured, it’s a DB-backed proof. |
| **Market signals** | **Dynamic** | From background scanner; if SERP isn’t configured, scanner uses mock data. |

So: **Ad is “static” in layout and branding; the text is dynamic when strategies/content_ideas exist, otherwise it falls back to static copy.**

## 3. What’s missing now (product gaps)

- **Full view for Pro content** — ✅ **Done.** Pitch Deck, Content Calendar, and Email Sequence now have full-content modals via “View Generated”.
- **Market Trends & Competitor Intel** — Intentionally blurred/locked for now; to be enabled later with real data and Pro.
- **Real SERP / market data** — SERP API not configured → “returning mock data”. Configure `SERP_API_KEY` and optional `ENABLE_LIVE_MARKET_DATA` in `backend/.env` when you want real data (see QUICK_START).
- **Rate limiting, RBAC, refresh tokens** — Not implemented; on PRODUCTION_ROADMAP Phase 1.
- **Real Google/Meta ads APIs, payment (Stripe), Celery/Redis** — On roadmap (Phases 2–4).
- **Export of Pitch Deck / Calendar / Email** — Currently view-only in the app (no PPTX/CSV/send-email export yet); roadmap Phase 3.

## 4. QUICK_START.md vs current state

- **Steps 1–2 (backend + frontend):** Still correct.
- **Step 3 (test):** You can also use “View Generated” for Pitch Deck, Content Calendar, and Email Sequence to see **full** content in modals.
- **Optional: Live market data, blockchain:** As in QUICK_START; SERP and blockchain are optional env vars.
- **Testing checklist:** Add:
  - [ ] Generate Pitch Deck → click “View Generated” → see full slides in modal.
  - [ ] Generate Content Calendar → “View Generated” → see full weeks/days/posts.
  - [ ] Generate Email Sequence → “View Generated” → see full emails (subject, body, CTA).

Nothing critical is **missing** from QUICK_START for basic flow; the new “full content” behavior is an improvement on top of it.

## 5. PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md vs current state

- **Phase 1 – Auth:** Registration and login (JWT, password hashing) are implemented in `server_enhanced.py`. Roadmap items still open: refresh tokens, dedicated auth module, RBAC, rate limiting, CORS tightening, DB indexes, structured logging, etc.
- **Phase 2 – Real data:** SERP optional; Google/Meta APIs, Redis, Celery not done.
- **Phase 3 – Execution:** No Google/Meta/LinkedIn campaign creation or SendGrid/Mailchimp yet; no export of deck/calendar/emails.
- **Phase 4 – Scale / launch:** Not started.

So: **nothing is “missing” from the roadmap docs** — they’re accurate. What’s missing is **doing** the unchecked roadmap tasks (security hardening, real APIs, execution integrations, monitoring, etc.). The only change in product behavior we made here is **full-content modals** for Pitch Deck, Content Calendar, and Email Sequence so “View Generated” is useful and testable.

## 6. Is the rest of the information “useful and true”?

- **Analysis (overview, SWOT, personas, strategies):** Generated from your inputs and (when available) SERP/market data. So it’s “true” relative to the model and the data you give it; if SERP is mock, competitor/market bits are synthetic.
- **Pitch Deck / Calendar / Email:** Same: useful and consistent with the analysis; full content is now visible in the new modals.
- **Market Trends / Competitor Intel:** Placeholder/blurred; not “real” data until you wire APIs and enable Pro.
- **Blockchain proof:** Real in the sense it’s stored and returned; “verified” depends on whether you have blockchain enabled.

For **testing**, the flow (analyze → generate deck/calendar/emails → “View Generated” → see full data) is now complete. Market Trends and Competitor Intel remain intentionally limited until you enable them later.
